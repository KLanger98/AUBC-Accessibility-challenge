# Adelaide University Coding Bootcamp - Accessibility Challenge

## Description
This project was provided by the Adelaide University Coding Bootcamp to practice improving the accessibility of an established starter code. The updated code improves accessibiity for assistive technologies and the readability of the code.

Through this project I learnt the process of adding comments, improving accessibility, using semantic HTML elements and consolidation of CSS.

## Usage
This accessibility challenge represents a business's webpage that describes key services and benefits that the business 'Horiseon' provides. 

When viewing the source code you fill find semantically organised HTML elements with appropriate comments to assist with identifying structure. 
By clicking links within the navigation bar you will be redirected to the appropriate associated content card on the webpage.
If the browser is unable to load the pages images, appropriate alt text has been provided to describe the images. 
When looking through the CSS stylesheet you will find oranised CSS selectors and properties based on semantic structure of the HTML elements. 
The HTML's title element has also been changed to provide a concise and descriptive title.
