# Adelaide University Coding Bootcamp - Accessibility Challenge

## Description
This project was provided by the Adelaide University Coding Bootcamp to practice improving the accessibility of an established starter code. The updated code improves accessibiity for assistive technologies and improves the readability of the code.
Throguh this project I learnt the process of adding comments, improving accessibility, using semantic HTML elements and consolidation of CSS.
